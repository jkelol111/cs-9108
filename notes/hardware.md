# Hardware

Hardware: physical components that make up a computer system.

Software: computer programs and related data that provide the instructions for telling computer hardware what to do and how to do it.

- Hardware and software have a symbolic relationship. This means that without software, hardware is very limited, and without hardware, software wouldn't be able to run at all. They need each other to work.

## Input, output and storage devices
All computing systems can be broken down into a basic input, processing, output and storage model.

- Hardware input devices such as keyboards, scanners or microphones, are used to input data that is processed by software programs (such as editing applications)
- Hardware output devices such as printers or screens are sued to output the information.

- If the device is putting data into the computer, int he form of text, sound, images button presses, etc, then it is an input device.
